By 1970, this had dropped to 23.9 and 21.8.<br><br>Marriage rates peaked in 1972 and have been in steep decline since. The latest data, for 2014, shows that only 23 out of every 1,000 unmarried men were tying the knot. Nowadays, the average first-time bride and groom are aged 32.7 and 30.8.<br><br>Meanwhile, the divorce rate has crept up over the decades, helped along by the Divorce Reform Act 1969 which allowed couples to divorce without either partner having to prove the other was at fault. However since 2004, the divorce rate has been falling steadily."]
